AVL balanced tree implementation

Following operations are implemented:

- node insertion
- calcuation hegiht of a node: the max between heigh of left subtree and height of right subtree
- check balance wether a tree meets the condition of AVL tree
- when a tree is unbalanced, right/left subtree rotation is performed to make the tree balanced
